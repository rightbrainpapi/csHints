# CS Hints

Has anyone ever asked you for a recommended list of coding resources? Well, our team has been asked many times over. This is why we decided to build CS Hints.

CS Hints cuts through the clutter to deliver coding resources built to help you master technical concepts. CS Hints allow users to search for, save, and share technical resources with friends or themselves.

When this project is finished users should be able to search for resources, pin those resources to their resource board, and sort resources into a personalized list for their own use or to share with others as a "recommendations".

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
