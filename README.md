# CS Hints

Has anyone ever asked you for a recommend list of coding resources? Well our team has been asked many times over. This is why we decided to build CS Hints.

CS Hints cuts through the clutter to deliver coding resources built to help you master technical concepts. CS Hints allows users to search for, save, and share technical resources with friends or themselves.

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
